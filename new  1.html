		Reflection:
		</h3>
	<body>
		Our first goal was to make a calculator by using gui and drawpad.
		After further research, we decided that that would be a little too much for
		us. We decided to make a simple calculator, but with many added functions.
		I thought it was well structured in my mind, in the sense that it used 
		functions effectively and has many uses. I thought the hardest part was 
		adding a while loop to the adding and averaging functions, because 
		I encountered many problems with changing variables. It was all worth 
		it though, we ended up with an adding function that could theoretically 
		take infinite inputs and add/average them together. The other functions 
		were relatively easy, even the pythagorean theorem function.
