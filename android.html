		Description:
		</h3>
	<body>
		The goal of this project was to create a game using MIT app inventor, that would run on android tablets.

		Personal Reflection:
		</h3>
	<body>
		The hardest part of this project was finding out how to move the sprites. 
		Going from python to this was a bit different, in the aspect that app inventor already has blocks set out for you. 
		Something that I could improve on would be to have better physics, because sometimes the ball will bounce off the 
		side and go straight down. If we had extra time, that would be the first thing I would do. Also, the change directions
		button occasionally doesnt work, which I think may be a problem with app inventor itself.
